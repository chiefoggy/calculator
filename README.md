The final project of The Odin Project's Foundations course! (hooray!)
This project made me realise how hard coding out a 'simple' calculator actually is (without the eval() function haha).
This calculator has the following functionalities:
1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division!
2. Allows typing in of inputs! Click on the display to do so.
3. Decimal points! (currently still a little wonky, would fix in future updates (if any))
